# Freeman-Generator
Allows you to generate a Freeman.

# Instructions (Linux (Mint) )
Step 1: Run "start.sh". Make sure to select "Run in Terminal".
OPTIONAL: Make sure the terminal window is fullscreen, otherwise you may not be able to view the full Freeman.
Step 2: Once the program is opened in your terminal, select if you would like to generate a Freeman by typing "Y/Yes" or "N/No".
Step 3: Then select your Freeman type, by typing "1" or "2".

Then, you should see a Freeman of your selected type appear shortly.

<sup>Note: logs.txt may have terminal logs in it already, and I'm too lazy to fix that currently. It doesn't really change anything, logs.txt just isn't empty prior to first run like it should be.</sup>
